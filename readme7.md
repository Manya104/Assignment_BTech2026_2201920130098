Design a class ShapeCalculator that calculates the area of different shapes using method overloading. Implement the below attributes and methods to calculate the area of different shapes :

Methods :

area (integer radius) : Calculates and return the area of circle using the formula π×radius2 .
area (integer length, integer width) : Calculates and return the area of rectangle using the formula (length * width).
area (integer base1, integer base2, double height) : Calculates and return the area of Trapezoid using the formula ( (base1 + base2) * height) / 2.


Refer the sample examples for understanding the output format.

Refer the commented code for the output statements.

Consider π = 3.14

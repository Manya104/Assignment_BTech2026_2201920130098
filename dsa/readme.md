Initialization:

ans is initialized to 0. This variable will store the cumulative XOR of all elements in the array.
Iterating through the Array:

A for loop runs through the entire array, and for each element, the XOR operation is performed with ans.
Properties of XOR:

XOR (^) has the following important properties:
a ^ a = 0 (any number XORed with itself is 0).
a ^ 0 = a (any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged).
XOR is commutative and associative (order does not matter).
Determining Validity:

At the end of the loop, ans will hold the XOR of all elements in the array.
If ans == 0, it means that the XOR of all elements cancels out, which implies that a valid array exists.
Returning the Result:

The function returns true if ans == 0, indicating that a valid array exists.
Otherwise, it returns false

Design a Library Management System in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system should allow:

Adding books with a unique ID, title, and author.
Borrowing books (only if available).
Returning books to the library.
Displaying available books in the library.
Ensure proper encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in your implementation.

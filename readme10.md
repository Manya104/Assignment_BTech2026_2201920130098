You are required to design a class Counter to keep track of how many objects have been created from it. The tracking must be done using the static keyword to ensure a single shared variable across all instances of the class. The class should contain below specification :

Attributes :

count (Integer) : A static variable that tracks the total number of objects created.
Methods :

A default constructor that increments the count variable each time a new object is instantiated.
getCount() : A static method that returns the current value of the count variable.
resetCount() : A static method to reset the value of count variable to 0.
